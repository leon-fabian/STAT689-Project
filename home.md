[Texas AgriLife Crop Testing](https://varietytesting.tamu.edu/), a unit of Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension, is the agency that conducts crop variety testing trials annually across strategic production regions throughout the state. For grain sorghum, these trials consist of commercially available hybrids as well as new experimental hybrids in the final stages of evaluation prior to commercialization. This multi-location testing provides decadesâ€™ worth of data across a wide range of environments (sub-tropical to temperate) which differ in soil types, moisture, temperature, day length, and cultural practices. Field production seasons range from February/March through July/August in South and Central Texas to May/June through September/October in the Rolling Plains and Texas Panhandle.

The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducts hundreds of surveys every year and prepares reports covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture. They report annual county crop yields for major crops, including grain sorghum. 

Collecting these datasets allows a retrospective on historical data which reveals patterns between agronomic practices, trait relationships, and production trends. 

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access the maps, data and charts concerning grain sorghum hybrid performance in Texas.
