## Welcome !

<i> Texas AgriLife Crop Testing </i> a unit of Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension, is the agency that conducts crop variety testing trials annually across strategic production regions throughout the state. For grain sorghum, these trials consist of commercially available hybrids as well as new experimental hybrids in the final stages of evaluation prior to commercialization. This multi-location testing provides decadesâ€™ worth of data across a wide range of environments (sub-tropical to temperate) which differ in soil types, moisture, temperature, day length, and cultural practices. Field production seasons range from February/March through July/August in South and Central Texas to May/June through September/October in the Rolling Plains and Texas Panhandle. Collecting these datasets along with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's annual data allows a retrospective on historical data which may reveal patterns in trait relationships or production trends without the need to gather germplasm and devise a trial as is commonly done in era studies. 

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access the maps, data and charts concerning grain sorghum hybrid performance in Texas.

It has been made with [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and you may find the code on [github](https://github.com/leon-fabian/STAT689-Project).
