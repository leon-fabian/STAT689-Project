## Introduction
Sorghum [Sorghum *bicolor* (L. Moench)] is the world's fifth most important cereal crop, in terms of both production and area planted. It is an increasingly relevant grain crop due to its resilience to drier and hotter climates. The United States is the worldâ€™s largest producer of grain sorghum, having produced 373 million bushels in 2020. Sorghum is typically grown in dryland areas from South Dakota to South Texas and Texas accounts for ~1.8 million of the United States' ~5.8 million acres of sorghum production. 

The idea for this visualization project is to use the [Texas A&M Variety Testing](http://varietytesting.tamu.edu/grainsorghum/) and [USDA NASS](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) data repositories on [grain sorghum](https://www.sorghumcheckoff.com/sorghum-101/) production to visualize yield and production trends for the state of Texas. 

## Inspiration

First, there already exists at least two examples of mapping the county-level production of sorghum acres.
The [USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Crops_County/index.php) reported maps.
And also, [Zachary Stansell](https://twitter.com/ZacharyStansell/status/1354612264679198722)'s [tool](https://gist.github.com/zacharystansell/fd1ebd6e3cda8a175680b78a4b271497) to map USDA crop data which uses [these APIs](https://sheilasaia.rbind.io/post/2020-06-30-nass-api-part2/).

Further inspiration motivates us to create a visualization like Zachary Labe's depiction of Arctic Sea Ice Volume/Thickness. This is a gif but an interactive approach could allow you to slide through years and see the changing geographic heat map of Texas trends.
