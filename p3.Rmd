## P3: Enrich/Format/Blend your Dataset

To start the data enrichment phase of the project, we joined all your different sources


### Adding geographic detail such as latitude and longitude


### Merging datasets: Year and County. 
USDA dataset's county names were in all-caps so they needed to be renamed to change that. 


### TX AgriLife Regions vs USDA Districts
The two datasets each included a Region column that were slightly different. We selected the Texas AgriLife regional distinctions as our chosen. 
Keep TX AgriLife Regions - ignore USDA Ag districts


Converted irrigation quantity data column observations from "none" to "0" and made the column an entirely numerical variable.
