# STAT689-Project
Fabian, Ram, and Ashok's data visualization project


The idea is to use the Texas A&M Variety Testing and USDA NASS data repositories on grain sorghum production to visualize yield and production trends for the state of Texas. Additionally, I have access to lots of data from my group's research around the state. I think anything developed from these data repositories could be shared/published via the Texas A&M Variety Testing websites or on its own and serve as a great resource for Texas farmers.
