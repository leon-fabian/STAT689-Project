# STAT689-Project
Fabian, Ram, and Ashok's data visualization project

Repository contains various files for STAT 689 assignments at Texas A&M University. 

Project:
The idea is to use the [Texas A&M Variety Testing](http://varietytesting.tamu.edu/grainsorghum/) and [USDA NASS](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) data repositories on [grain sorghum](https://www.sorghumcheckoff.com/sorghum-101/) production to visualize sorghum grain yield and production trends for the state of Texas. 

This could be shared/published via the Texas A&M Variety Testing websites or on its own and serve as a great resource for Texas farmers.
