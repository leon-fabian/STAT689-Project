### Introduction 
Sorghum [Sorghum *bicolor* (L. Moench)] is the world's fifth most important cereal crop, in terms of both production and area planted. It is an increasingly relevant grain crop due to its resilience to drier and hotter climates. In the United States, sorghum is typically grown in dryland areas in Kansas and Texas with Texas accounting for ~1.8 million of the United States' ~5.8 million acres of sorghum production. The circumstances of where it is grown mean that sorghum usually does not meet its optimal yield potential. To ensure that the best decisions are being made to achieve maximal sorghum yields despite poor growing conditions we attempt to visualize trends in the environmental, genetic, and agronomic factors affecting yield. 


### Motivation
The idea for this visualization project was to use the [Texas A&M Variety Testing](http://varietytesting.tamu.edu/grainsorghum/) and [USDA NASS](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) data repositories on [grain sorghum](https://www.sorghumcheckoff.com/sorghum-101/) production to visualize yield and agricultural production trends for the state of Texas. The first dataset is from Texas A&M Agrilife, which contains data from 1970 - 2021 Texas Sorghum Variety Trials. The second is the dataset from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics website that was collected to reflect this same time period. While agronomists attempt to look at the trends through their research, individual experimental attempts seldom span as long a time period. Visualizing these datasets is the best representation of historical trends for Texas production regions as could be compiled.  

### Visualization Design/Implementation




### Methodology
Clearly state why & how can your data visualization be used to solve the research questions






### Evaluation Plan



### Discussions & Future Work
The final data visualization dashboard encompasses a large breadth of agronomic and historical insights. However, beyond the agronomic practices, further work should be conducted to narrow in on the environmental and genetic components of these trials. This area of study is exceedingly complicated by cross-over interactions between the agronomic practices, environmental conditions, and the plant's genetics. Typically, these interactions are very specific to a production practice or geographic area. These type of research questions are best addressed with targeted experimentation and not well suited for investigation via a large retrospective like we present. 

Delivering these types of trends into the hands of farmers and decision makers is the ultimate goal of these visualizations. Farmers adopting practices is the best best case scenario, however, they are notoriously difficult stakeholders to influence. For example, despite a wealth of previous knowledge and many of our visualizations suggesting that taller plants achieve higher yields, there is still a preference amongst farmers for shorter sorghum hybrids. There exists a misconception that the tallest plants will blow over and lodge despite our data suggesting that only becomes a concern at plant heights taller than ~160cm. As it stands, the average sorghum hybrid height submitted to these trials is ~125cm. There still exists lots of room for greater plant heights in the Texas grain sorghum industry. 

The nature of these data is that they are annually updated with the latest year's production. This work will need to be updated annually to incorporate the most current information into these trends.
