### Introduction 
Sorghum [Sorghum *bicolor* (L. Moench)] is the world's fifth most important cereal crop, in terms of both production and area planted. It is an increasingly relevant grain crop due to its resilience to drier and hotter climates. In the United States, sorghum is typically grown in dryland areas in Kansas and Texas with Texas accounting for ~1.8 million of the United States' ~5.8 million acres of sorghum production. The circumstances of where it is grown mean that sorghum usually does not meet its maximal yield potential. To ensure that the best decisions are being made to achieve maximal sorghum yields we attempt to visualize trends in the environmental, genetic, and agronomic factors affecting yield. 


### Motivation
The idea for this visualization project is to use the [Texas A&M Variety Testing](http://varietytesting.tamu.edu/grainsorghum/) and [USDA NASS](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) data repositories on [grain sorghum](https://www.sorghumcheckoff.com/sorghum-101/) production to visualize yield and agricultural production trends for the state of Texas. The first dataset is from Texas A&M Agrilife, which contains data from 1970 - 2021 Texas Sorghum Variety Trials. The second is the dataset from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics website that was collected to reflect this same time period. While agronomists attempt to look at the trends through their research, individual experimental attempts seldom span such a long time period. Visualizing these datasets is truly
